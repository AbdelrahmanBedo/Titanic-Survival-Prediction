Titanic Survival Prediction
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. It involves data processing, visualization, preprocessing, model training, testing, and evaluation.

Files Included
train.csv: Training data containing passenger information.
test.csv: Test data for prediction.
gender_submission.csv: Sample submission file with passenger ID and predicted survival.
Project Structure
titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing code for data processing, visualization, model training, testing, and evaluation.
README.md: Readme file providing an overview of the project.
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:
bash

Install the required libraries:

Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Run the Jupyter Notebook titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb to execute the code.

Data Processing and Visualization

Missing values in the dataset are handled by filling with median values.

Data visualization techniques such as violin plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and histograms are used to explore relationships and distributions in the data.

Data Preprocessing

Categorical variables are encoded using LabelEncoder.
Numeric data is scaled using Min-Max Scaling.
Model Training and Testing

Logistic Regression model is trained using the training data.
The trained model is tested on the test data to make predictions.

Model Evaluation
Accuracy score is calculated to evaluate the performance of the model.
True labels from the sample submission file are used for evaluation.

Results

The project aims to achieve accurate predictions of passenger survival on the Titanic dataset. Refer to the Jupyter Notebook for detailed implementation and analysis.
